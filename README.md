# prantar.me-chrome-extension
Chrome extension made for my website. Only works with the index page of my site.

It can be found in the chrome web store as https://prantar.me

Determines if the site has been updated by looking at the last updated date of the site. Can be changed to use all text to compare but checking it with the date saves memory.
